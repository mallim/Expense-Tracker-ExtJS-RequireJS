# Expense Tracker with ExtJS 3.4, RequireJS and AMD

This is experimental code to see if I could build an [ExtJS 3.4](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs3/) app with [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD). It's not particularly useful since [Ext 4.x](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/) has its own MVC and module system.

# Forked Additions

* Added node express web server so that it is easier to just see the running site

# Instruction

Run npm install to install the node components

Then follow by 

     node server.js

And you can see a running site at

     http://localhost:3000/index.html
